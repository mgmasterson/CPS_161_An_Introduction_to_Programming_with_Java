# CPS_161_An_Introduction_to_Programming_with_Java
In this course, students are introduced to the Java programming language. Looping, conditional logic and string manipulation are some of the basic programming concepts covered. Object-oriented concepts are covered such as constructors, polymorphism, abstract classes, interfaces and exceptions. Graphical user interface (GUI) topics are minimally covered. CPS 261 will cover these topics in depth. Prior programming experience is recommended. Students who have no programming experience should consider taking CPS 120. This course was previously CIS 175.
